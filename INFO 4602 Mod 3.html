<h1>INFO 4602 - Module Three</h1>

<p>As an NBA fan, a question that gets repeated every season time and time again is, “Who is the most valuable player?” Believe it or not, this is a very polarizing question, especially among the NBA fan community online. Countless hostile interactions take place across a variety of social media platforms almost every day, debating who deserves the award. For Denver Nuggets fans, the clear cut favorite the entire 20-21 season has been Serbian big man Nikola Jokic. Since joining the team in 2015, he has been a revelation, and a huge reason why the franchise went from one of the league’s worst, to a title contender this year. However this year Jokic has taken yet another step, and put him in the conversation as one of the league’s best players. To Denver Nuggets fans he’s an obvious choice for the most valuable player award, as he’s putting up stats that have never been seen before in the NBA. Outside of Denver though, he still has yet to really get any recognition as a top five player in the NBA. Many mainstream media outlets don’t seem to recognize this as well, with ESPN barely giving him any coverage in comparison to other MVP favorites. I put together a supplementary viz, as I was curious to see just how much the media has ignored Jokic. As shoawn, Jokic has recieved 1/4th of the coverage of Lebron on Twitter, despite being 5x more likely to win MVP. According to betting odds, Jokic has emerged as the clear favorite to take the award. I want to look at statistics from past winners, and hopefully answer the question, does Nikola Jokic deserve to win NBA MVP?

<p>Using basketball reference, (https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/mvp.html) I pulled statistics from every MVP’s season. I then pulled the same stats for just Nikola Jokic using the same site. I want to compare these statistics in order to better contextualize the kind of season Nikola Jokic is having. I think most members of the NBA media don’t realize he’s putting up similarly impressive numbers to past MVP’s. There are definitely a couple of biases in the stats though, comparing players that played in the 80’s to Jokic isn’t as significant as comparing him to modern players. This is due to the fact of how much basketball has changed as a sport since the 80’s. Many rules and strategies have evolved greatly since then. Another bias in the data could arise when considering Jokic has only played around 60% of the season so far. Every other player I will be comparing him to played more games, so Jokic’s numbers are a smaller sample size. However I will be comparing percentages and averages of players rather than totals.
</p>

<p>I want the visualization to be able to not only highlight Jokic’s stats among other MVP’s, but allow the user to compare specific MVP seasons to Jokic. I want these specific tasks to be pursued because I think it’ll highlight Jokic is having a similar or even better season than past MVP’s. My vision is that that user is able to freely compare statistics of Jokic’s season with any other MVP’s season. I imagine the user using a drop down menu or check box in order to choose what seasons they’d like to compare. </p>

<p>I know my sketch is poor but I just want to emphasize that I’d like to separate different statistics from each other in order for better presentation. I would also like to have a menu of every player if possible, as it would easier for the user to navigate between comparisons.</p>

<p>For my final implementation I settled on a multi checkable menu which allows the user to compare whatever players they’d like. My intentions going in were to only allow a single comparison alongside Nikola Jokic, however I found that being able to compare different MVP’s to each other allowed for more contextual information. </p>

<p>
I chose to display game averages, player rating, and player shooting percentages in the dashboard. I think these 3 categories of statistics provide proper insight into what kind of numbers it takes to be an MVP. I think comparing Jokic with any other MVP demonstrates he should be the MVP. </p>

<p>
	A task I’d like to iterate into the vis is the ability for the user to choose the statistical categories they’d like to compare. I found there was just too many statistics to fit into my design for the vis, I had to narrow down the 3 categories that I found to be the most telling. However I left out statistics like win shares, which should be considered when voting for most valuable player. Something else I’d like to add is a zoom function, so users can compare every player’s offensive and defensive rating if they’d like to. Another task I’d like to add is a link to a glossary of sorts non NBA literate viewers of the viz. I think the statistics are nicely highlighted and easy to read, I just want to make sure the reader understands the significance of them, no matter how big or small of an NBA fan they might be.

<p>The dashboard exemplifies just how historic the numbers Nikola Jokic is putting up this season. By allowing the user to compare Jokic’s stats to players like Michael Jordan, they can see that Jokic is indeed having a historic season, despite what the media may be saying about other players. This contextual information is very valuable when debating who deserves the reward.The dashboard exemplifies just how historic the numbers Nikola Jokic is putting up this season.

<p>I think if I were to do this again I’d make sure to have a bigger focus on how the statistics apply to Nikola Jokic. I think the existing dashboard does a good job of displaying the statistics, but users might draw different conclusions due to the varying views that the dashboard offers. While I still want to offer the varying views, I’d like to figure out how to maybe incorporate Jokic into every view, as it would be more beneficial regarding the problem. I do however think that the various statistical displays are a good strategy for conveying multiple kinds of information at once. </p>
