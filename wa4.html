<h1 id="text">Leopold "Butters" Stotch</h1>
<p> <span class="para">American television through the 21st century has encapsulated very emotionally complex characters in various ways. From Walter White to Daenerys Targaryen, the past 20 or so years has given us countless iconic characters in TV that will be remembered forever. However, one particular character in the animated series South Park I believe is written so emotionally complex, many viewers often overlook him as a geeky kid. Obviously, I’m talking about the one and only Leopold “Butters” Stotch. The seemingly innocent punching bag on the surface, Butters emotional complexity is often on display during his evolution as a character.

<p> <span class="para">Butters personality is very warm, and very innocent. He is unique in the sense that he is the most childish character on the show, despite most of the characters being children. As seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BivJulZofLU">this video</a>, he can be extremely gullible as well. There are many words to describe Butters, and each episode paints him in a different light. 
</span> </p>

<p> <span class="para">It is important to note Butters rise as a character during the running of South Park. Using a dataset of all characters lines season 1-18 <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tovarischsukhov/southparklines">(obtained here)</a>, it is easy to figure out when exactly the writers shoved Butters in the spotlight.  As shown in the figure, Butters never saw much screen time the first few seasons, in fact he wasn’t a character in season one. It was only as the show progressed viewers started seeing more of Butters. Leading to season six, with a max of 378 lines in the season, “Butters' role gradually began to increase after he replaced Kenny during his temporary removal in Season Six. This allowed Butters to gain more screen time and further develop his character.” (South Park Fandom) By far the most amount of dialogue he has in any season, season six really develops Butters into a major character for many episodes to come.

<p> <span class="para">The other side of Butters comes out during this season in the episode “Professor Chaos”. Butters is kicked out of his friend group, feeling like an outsider he develops an alter ego, and plans to wreak havoc on the city of South Park. It is unfortunate, but when considering his surroundings and the environment Butters is in, it is almost expected. Butters' relationship with the people in his life is well demonstrated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVSbSPGDwv8&t">this scene</a>. (Warning: Language) Butter is constantly in a cycle of mistreatment by both his friends and parents. </span> </p>

<p> <span class="para">His venture into Professor Chaos almost reveals just how warmhearted Butters actually is. Despite feverishly trying to wreak havoc on the city, he is simply too sweet to do so. But it also shows a side to Butters that might be his biggest downfall, his naivety. It is evident that the writers of the show have shown a side of Butters that a casual viewer would not expect to see. It is important to note he is more than Carman’s punching bag.</span> </p>
