  <h2>Types of Arrests in Denver(2012)</h2>
  <h3>The chart below details the number arrests made after a specific type of stop within Denver. The chart shows a higher amount of arrests are made from vehicle stops. This is likely attributed to Denver being a very drivable city, and possibly even the effects of bad weather. A further question to look into would be, do the % of vehicular arrests in downtown denver rise during winter?</h3>
