    <h1>Doge</h1>      
    <p>Is Doge a bubble?</p>
  </div>
  <p>The rise of Dogecoin since the turn of 2021 is surprising to say the least. What was once regarded as a joke, has now multiped 50x, making many early investors rich. But what is next for Dogecoin? Is it going to a dollar? As a novice crypto investor, from my perspective I find Doge to be just another ponzi scheme like bubble, that will ultimately end with a lot of people getting hurt.</p>

  <p>With the unprecedented amount of stimulus being injected into the US economy, it is no surprise that certain “assets” such as Dogecoin have found themselves increasing in value 50x. As you can see from the chart below, until 2021, for most of Doge’s existence, it has remained under a penny. This makes almost sense, as Doge inflates infinitely and has virtually no tangible value whatsoever. However we’ve come to find out that the crypto market isn’t about making sense, it is about speculation. The rocket Doge has been riding is nothing short of remarkable, however when you look at other famous bubbles, there are eerily similar features.</p>

  <p>When cannabis company Tilray IPO’d back in 2018, investors were quick to jump onto the prospective cannabis industry. While Tilray definitely holds more tangible value, investors pumped the value to astronomical proportions. As seen from the chart below, the exponential gain is very similar to dogecoin. What will also be similar is the drop that follows the exponential gain. It takes time for a bubble to deflate, but it is only a matter of time.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that cryptocurrency trades a lot differently compared to a stock. However, the market principles remain intact, and I predict dogecoin finds itself under .01 in the near future.</p>


  <p>Interestingly enough, the price of Dogecoin is correlated with how burnt out I am this semester. As the price of Doge has risen, it has risen exponentially, similar to how burnt out I have been this semester. For context, I felt a little wave of lack of motivation in February, but it really took control in April, which is why you see a lack of reveal.js visualizations on this webpage.  I really couldn’t figure out how to pull my own data into reveal.js (even though I think it was shown in class), and I am too burnt out and too stressed about finals to try spending more time trying to figure it out.</p>
