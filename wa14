<p>In order to properly present my findings surrounding South Park, I would have to be flexible and know my audience. If I was presenting to the show creators, I would certainly use a reveal.js presentation in order to get my information across. This way, the information is still very readable to people that may not have experience in data.
Second, if I were to present to someone who had never watched the show before, I would possibly also use a reveal.js presentation, however in a less formal setting, a Twitter thread would be very effective. This way I could tell a story to the audience with the data I find, and am able to weave in video evidence from the show. 
Lastly, if I was presenting South Park findings to the TV Network, I would also use a reveal.js presentation, however I would primarily focus on the statistics of the show in this instance. I would pull ratings over the 24 running years in order to present a comprehensive argument on why they should still show the show.</p>
