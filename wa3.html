<h1>Gamestop and The Federal Reserve</h1>
<p>The situation that has unfolded with Gamestop is certainly one of most memorable market stories in our lifetimes. For good reason, it is truly something groundbreaking when accounting for all the factors that led to this market frenzy that we’ve seen. During all this madness the mainstream media as well as Reddit itself has missed a huge underlying factor that has undoubtedly contributed to the retail investor distrust in the market. There is no doubt Reddit is right when it comes to many hedge funds impacting the market in a very fraudulent manner, however in my opinion, a just as bad offender can be found in the Federal Reserve. With all the data available around the Federal Reserve, and more broadly the entire U.S economy, it is puzzling more people aren’t pointing their finger at the US Central Bank.
</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has enabled skewed pricing in the market with little regard for any fundamentals for several years now. While this may seem like a random outlandish claim, there are 10 million people currently unemployed while the S&P 500 surges to new highs. The Federal Reserve is responsible for stimulating a dangerous system in which money almost seems endless. As shown below, the balance sheet has been expanding since the financial crisis of 2008, which makes perfect sense. However what doesn’t make sense is the balance sheet expanding in an already thriving economy, and not shrinking during “the best economy in American history” according to former president Donald Trump. Maintaining Quanitative Easing during a "healthy econonmy" is a dangerous precedent a couple reasons.
<ul>
	<li>It will limit future recovery efforts as needed</li>
	<li>Further dilute the US dollar</li>
	<li>Risk of hyperinflation</li>
</ul>
 So why does this matter? Well, as the balance sheet expands and the Fed continues to buy assets, it further dilutes the US money supply, directly impacting almost every American. What is really chilling is a decent chunk of the money printed is used to buy corporate debt, directly benefiting corporations. Sure every American has gotten 2 stimulus checks, but that is a drop in the bucket compared to what the Fed has injected directly into corporations and the market.</p>

<p>So why is this important? Not only does the Federal Reserve directly contribute to the widening wealth gap, but it also promotes the aggressive behavior seen in modern hedge funds. 
Fundamentals of earnings don’t matter anymore. Wallstreetbets and Gamestop was just the extreme example needed to shed light on the insane market traditions. Not even months before, Tesla stock, although having certainly a brighter future than Gamestop, went up 10x in value. Their earnings didn’t go up 10x in value. With so much money being funneled into the system, institutional investors are free to speculate, driving up the market to obscene levels that are seen in Tesla. All of this was happening in the market before the Gamestop craze, it just wasn’t a story because elitists were doing it, being enabled by the Federal Reserve.  
</p>
<p>Regarding the wealth gap, since the turn of the 21st century it has only been expanding for the 1%’s favor. As seen in the figure below, it has only gotten worse to be in the bottom 50% in America. This can be explained simply because the most Americans can set aside the money to own stock. While blue chip stocks like Apple double in a year off the back of stimulus, making investors billions, Americans are still clamoring for a $2,000 stimulus check. </p>

<p>It is hard to pinpoint exactly why an anti-elite populist outrage awoke so quickly. Certainly the factors highlighted in this essay contributed to this 2021 edition of “Occupy Wallstreet”. Reddit has done everything it can now to go after certain hedge funds for what they have done to the markets. However, it is important to find the distinction between malicious intent and using malicious intent. Maybe controversial, but it is not outlandish to say hedge funds are just taking advantage of the abysmal monetary policies the Federal Reserve has turned to. That doesn’t make them innocent, but it is easy to deflect blame and lose sight of the true villains in a world of too much information.
